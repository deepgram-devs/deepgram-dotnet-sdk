# Getting an API Key

🔑 To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

# Documentation

Complete documentation of the .NET SDK can be found on the
[Deepgram Docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/dotnet-sdk).

You can learn more about the full Deepgram API at [https://developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com).

# Installation

To install the C# SDK using NuGet:

Run the following command from your terminal in your projects directory:

```bash
dotnet add package Deepgram
```

Or use the Nuget package Manager.

Right click on project and select manage nuget packages

# Targeted Frameworks

- 7.0.x
- 6.0.x

# Configuration

To setup the configuration of the Deepgram Client you can do one of the following:

- Create a Deepgram Client instance and pass in credentials in the constructor.

```csharp
var credentials = new Credentials(YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);
var deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient(credentials);
```

# Examples

To quickly get started with examples for prerecorded and streaming, run the files in the example folder. See the README in that folder for more information on getting started.

# Transcription

## Remote Files

```csharp
using Deepgram.Models;

var credentials = new Credentials(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

var deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient(credentials);

var response = await deepgramClient.Transcription.Prerecorded.GetTranscriptionAsync(
    new UrlSource("https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"),

# Logging

The Library uses Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to preform all of its logging tasks. To configure
logging for your app simply create a new `ILoggerFactory` and call the `LogProvider.SetLogFactory()`
method to tell the Deepgram library how to log. For example, to log to the console with Serilog, you'd need to install the Serilog package with `dotnet add package Serilog` and then do the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Deepgram.Logger;
using Serilog;

var log = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .MinimumLevel.Debug()
    .WriteTo.Console(outputTemplate: "{Timestamp:HH:mm} [{Level}]: {Message}\n")
    .CreateLogger();
var factory = new LoggerFactory();
factory.AddSerilog(log);
LogProvider.SetLogFactory(factory);
```
